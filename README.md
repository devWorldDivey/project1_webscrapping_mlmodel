<h1>Project details:</h1><br/>
This web app allows a user to evaluate random brands by writing reviews. While writing, the user will see the sentiment score of his input updating in 
real-time along with a proposed rating from 1 to 5.

The user can then change the rating in case the suggested one does not reflect his views, and submit.
You can think of this as a crowdsourcing app of brand reviews with a sentiment analysis model that suggests ratings that the user can tweak and adapt afterward.

To build this application we'll follow these steps:

1. Collecting and scraping customer reviews data using Selenium and Scrapy
2. Training a deep learning sentiment classifier on this data using PyTorch
3. Building an interactive web app using Dash
4. Setting a REST API and a Postgres database
5. Dockerizing the app using Docker Compose
6. Deploying to AZURE
